Aws services to deploy 
used EC2 / cloud formation (Iaas) / Elastic beanstalk (Baas)

using cloud things to solve problem / scalable / pay as per used


Adv :
 speed /low infrastructure cost /scalability / reliability / usage based coast 


Nano services - 
 next gen of microservice
 do one thing
 async event based triggers



Aws lambda : 
 - compute services allows to write code and run response as event to other resources 
  interact other resources 
   having handler fun to interact 
   security - use iam resource policy  to invoke
   add iam role for handler to use / interact with other resource as per the permissions


Baas services : backend as services
 server -top->app -top->fun
 Faas :
  lambda fun - trigger by event s3 /sns/ dynamodb


lambda : 
    lambda invoke ===> create lambda host env => lambda vm
    => lambda runtime => invoke lambda fun
    
invocation type and modes:
    using GUI
    console
    cli/sdk
    api getway
    Modes : 
        sync - api getway , cloudfront, alexa  ==return response
        async - s3, sns, cloudformation == 
        polling - not trigger if data present then it works  - sqs,dynamo db streams, kinesis data streams

    
BOTO3 : 
    aws lib to interact aws cloud

15 min to complete works for lambda
1000 exec at a time
4 kb env var
64 mb for sync param
256 mb for Async param
charges only time to run fun and memory.

Cloud formation : create zip - upload to s3 - create Iam - resources - fun - configure permissions

SAM CLI: 
    superset of cloud formation
    sam build /sam deploy
